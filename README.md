Repository to store my .vimrc file settings

## What is a VIMRC file?

Settings file used by Vim, a text editing program often used by source code developers and system administrators; saves the default settings for the editor when it is opened; allows users to customize options for the editor.

## More Information

VIMRC files are saved in a plain text format. They store a series of instructions, each of which can be run manually in the Vim editor by typing a colon ":" character and entering the command. Common settings include text indentation properties and window and font colors.

On Unix-based systems (Linux, Mac OS X, etc.), VIMRC files are saved to the user's home directory as a hidden file with no filename prefix (~/.vimrc).

_NOTE:_ gVim, the Windows Vim editor, uses a file with the name \_vimrc instead of .vimrc.
